INSPIRATION:
Prior to 2020, the teacher student relationship was usually considered to be a face-to-face one where human interaction was important for progress. However, due to circumstances , we had to adapt to an online platform for health safety. However, this in turn resulted in providing a larger access to information for all people worldwide who are willing to learn. Extending this idea, our team decided that there should be a platform that provides a tutoring service to all people who require assistance across all topics of education for all ages. This provides access to people worldwide who are limited financially but still have a desire to learn and wished to be helped. We are promoting a teacher student interaction online to ensure the human (computer) touch isn't fully eradicated in a current world of online learning.


WHAT IT DOES:
BudgetLearn is a web application where tutors and students are able to register on the home page. The tutors's are directed into a page where they fill out a form listing their information and provide a verification for their prior experience in the topic they claim to have an experience in. Students on the other hand just have to register with their contact details, credit card information and their budget for tutor sessions which we monitor to help them. After selecting a topic, they are directed to a page where they have a list of available tutors and price per hour and a link to contact them.
